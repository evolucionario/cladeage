Description: These functions model the uncertainty about the age of a clade based on its fossil record. The primary strategy is to generate a random sample of possible clade ages using quantile functions. These numbers can then be used to generate a histogram and fit probability functions for using as priors in Bayesian divergence time estimation (Claramunt & Cracraft 2015).
